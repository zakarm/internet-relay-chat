    file: channel.cpp : issue to fix
        - what if there's no operators left (mode -o in a channel with only one operator)
    file: commands.cpp
        - add replies to modes (all excepte o)
        - l_mode WTF is conver_to_int for???
        - fix this in cmdMode function:
                    else if (mode.empty())
                        std::cout << "in progress" << std::endl;
                    ...
                    ...
        - cmd_user should accept 1 or 4 parameters
        - what if there was no more operators left in the channel (mode -o in a channel with only one operator)
