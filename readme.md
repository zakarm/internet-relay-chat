# IRC Server (ircserv)

# Overview
This project implements an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server in C++ 98. The server is capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously without hanging and utilizes non-blocking I/O operations. The server allows clients to connect, authenticate, set nicknames, join channels, send and receive private messages, and interact with channels. It supports basic IRC functionalities along with features specific to channel operators such as kicking users, inviting users, changing/viewing channel topics, and modifying channel modes.
